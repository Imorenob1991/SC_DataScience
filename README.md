## Conceptual Analysis

The first topic we are going to analyze is the ABC segmentation of sales and stocks, based on the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80:20 rule.

### About the Pareto Principle
The Pareto Principle was formulated by Vilfredo Pareto in 1896. It states that 80% of outcomes are controlled by 20% of the factors. For example, 80% of total sales are generated by 20% of total products.

### Application in Supply Chain

ABC Classification in Sales:
  - A Products: Generate 80% of total sales. These are usually referred as fast-moving goods.
  - B Products: Generate 15% of total sales. These are usually referred as medium/regular moving goods.
  - C Products: Generate 5% of total sales. These are usually referred as slow-moving goods.

Before defining the type of products, it is important to sort the database from the product with the highest sales (first row) to the product with the lowest sales (last row). This will become clearer with the code.
