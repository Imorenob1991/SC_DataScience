## Conceptual Analysis

The first topic we are going to analyze is the ABC segmentation of sales, based on the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80:20 rule.

### About the Pareto Principle
The Pareto Principle was formulated by Vilfredo Pareto in 1896. It states that 80% of outcomes are controlled by 20% of the factors. For example, 80% of total sales are generated by 20% of total products.

### Application in Supply Chain

Common ABC Classification:
  - A Products: 20% of SKUs that generate 80% of total sales. These are usually referred as fast-moving goods.
  - B Products: 30% of SKUs that generate 15% of total sales. These are usually referred as medium/regular moving goods.
  - C Products: 50% of SKUs that generate 5% of total sales. These are usually referred as slow-moving goods.

Before defining the type of products, it is important to sort the database from the product with the highest sales (first row) to the product with the lowest sales (last row), in a defined period of time (days, weeks, months, years).

The most common curve is going to be represented by the 80:20 rule , but regarding of the industry and strategy of each company, you will see different curves like: 70:30 or 50:50. This is mainly affected by the type of industry and the assortment strategy.

Descriptive Analysis:
- Type A Product: 20% of SKUs represent the 80% of total sales and are fast moving goods.
- Type B Products: 30% of SKUs represent the 15% of total sales and are regular moving goods.
- Type C Products: 50% of SKUs represent the 5% of the total sales and are slow moving goods.

Insights and potential analysis:
- It is recommended that fast moving goods or Type A Products have to be stored in the ubication that require minimun store or warehouse transits, regarding of the Layout.
- Additionally, the A Products have a high possibility of being sold, so we can decide to stock these type of products in a location closer to our clients to improve our service level.
- This type of curve is suitable for Autostore Automation Goods to Person Technology, but we need to dip dive in other factors like the logistics variables and the size of the products (Autostore is suitable for small items)
